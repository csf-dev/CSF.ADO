This repository has been **archived** and merged into **[CSF.ORM](https://github.com/csf-dev/CSF.ORM)**.  Further development on this work can be found there.

*It was found that a number of repositories were so closely linked that they should be converted to a single repository, even though they are multiple separate NuGet packages.*

# CSF.Data
These types assist in operating with data-sources.  Highlights are:

## IQuery
This is an interface which is designed to be used within applications that need access to an object-based data-source, such as an ORM.
Essentially it is an interface for a generic repository service, which exposes a data-source via Linq.
Firstly, this permits abstracting away from that data-source's own interfaces.
Secondly, it solves a specific problem present in the **NHibernate** ORM, in that the `ISession.Query<T>()` method is an extension method, which is problematic to mock in unit tests.

## InMemoryQuery
This implementation of `IQuery` holds data transiently in-memory.
It may be used as a data-source where an in-memory repository is appropriate.
It may also be used as a test fake, for substituting a real (database-backed) query in unit tests.

## InMemoryDataReader
This type is intended to be used as a test fake, when you wish to mock `IDataReader`.
It exposes a data-set which is passed into the constructor.
